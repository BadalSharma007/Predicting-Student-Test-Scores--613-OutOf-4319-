📌 Project Title
Playground Series — Season 6 Episode 1 | Kaggle Competition Solution

📖 Description
This repository contains my solution for the Playground Series — Season 6 Episode 1 competition hosted on Kaggle. The goal of this competition was to build a robust machine learning model to accurately predict the target variable using the provided training dataset and maximize performance on the held-out test set.

I explored feature engineering, model selection, tuning, and evaluation techniques to optimize performance. After training and validating several models, the final solution achieved a Kaggle leaderboard rank of 613 out of 4319 participants — placing it in the top ~15% of all submissions.

Throughout this project, I applied various data preprocessing strategies, model training workflows, and performance improvement methods, demonstrating strong practical ML skills and a competitive approach to real-world data science challenges.
